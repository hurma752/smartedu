# app/services/progress_service.py
"""
Per-student progress analytics (daily / weekly / monthly) — Module 3 extension.

DESIGN NOTES — read before changing:

1. NO NEW TABLES. Every number here is derived from data SmartEdu already
   records: AttendanceRecord (+ ClassSession.session_date), Submission
   (+submitted_at/status), FinalGrade (+total_score), Assignment (+due_date),
   Rubric (+total_marks) and EngagementEvent (+created_at). Progress is a
   *view* over existing history, not a second copy of it.

2. RISK HISTORY IS REPLAYED, NOT STORED. StudentRiskAssessment keeps exactly
   one row per (student, course) and is overwritten on every recompute, so
   there is no stored risk history to chart. Rather than adding a snapshot
   table — which would show an empty chart until months of data accumulated,
   useless for a demo — risk is RECONSTRUCTED for each past period by
   filtering the timeline to `<= period_end` and re-scoring. Every input is
   timestamped, so this is exact.

   The replay uses the *rule-based* scorer (_point_in_time_risk), NOT the
   RandomForest from analytics_service. That is deliberate and should be
   stated in the FYP report: the forest is fitted on the CURRENT cohort's
   feature distribution, so applying it to a past week would score that week
   using information that did not exist yet (look-ahead bias). The rule
   thresholds are imported from analytics_service so the two never drift.

   The rule scorer is also CONTINUOUS here (graded shortfall against each
   threshold) rather than the binary 0.85/0.15 flip used in the fallback
   path, because a chart of a value that only ever takes two values is not
   a trend chart.

3. ONE COLLECTION PASS PER STUDENT. _collect_timeline() runs ~5 queries and
   returns plain dated tuples; every granularity, every period and every
   risk replay is then computed in memory from that one pass. The teacher
   overview therefore costs ~5N queries for N students, not 5N x periods.

4. HONEST NULLS. A period with no class sessions has attendance_rate = None,
   not 0. Weights are renormalised over the components that actually have
   data (_weighted_score), so a week where the teacher marked no attendance
   does not silently drag a student's score down.
